```User Grouping Service```
version: 0.1.0
contact: {'name': 'Developer @Sci-Code', 'url': 'https://sci-code.com', 'email': 'developer@sci-code.com'}
description: User Grouping is about dividing users into a number
of groups such that users in the same groups are more similar
to other users in the same group than those in other groups.
In simple words, the aim is to groups users that share certain traits
into clusters.

# Introduction

The User Grouping service allows us to group users in various
ways, using different techniques. We can assign users to certain
data structures, or we can group them algoritmically using various
clustering algorithms.

# Authentication

This API supports OAuth2, and more specifically, the implicit flow.
