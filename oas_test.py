description: Answers are responses to exercises. Some of them are correct, some of them not.
The Answer Service deals with everything that's necessary to keep track of 
answers to exercises over time. 

# Introduction

The answers service handles some advanced processing of certain answers. For example, an 
answer to the popular codebase exercise type requires processing of archived files usually
in a zip file, and then a translation into multiple post requests for each file that has 
changed since the last posted answer to the same exercise.

# Answer Types

The structure of answers depends on the exercise types they answer. The exercise 
types which form the basis for answer types can be seen below.

# Authentication

This API supports OAuth2, and more specifically, the implicit flow.
